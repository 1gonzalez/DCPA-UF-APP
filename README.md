## Description:

The name for our project is DCPA UF App which is an acronym that simply describes the name of the organization and our university. Our plan is to build a mobile application for the Design, Construction, and Planning Ambassadors (DCPA). This is an organization that has a goal of generating interest and attracting new students to the College of Design, Construction, and Planning. This app will consist of multiple features that will aid both members of the DCPA and students who plan on joining the DCP college in the future. For the former, this app will give the Ambassadors a way of being better organized, by using features such as a event list, which they can use to schedule meetings and events, have a clear-cut schedule of tours, and more. The app will also give the Ambassadors the ability to describe the organization and include all the events that the organization might host. For prospective students, they will be able to schedule tours through the email feature within the app, and in the case that the student is not able to attend an in-person tour, the app will also offer a virtual tour option. . Other features that the app will include are a map that will show the location of the user, that way they are able to find their way around campus, as well as a feature that will have general information about the DCP ambassados and the DCP college in general.
